00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,460
Hey everyone, Grant here.

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,828
This is the first video in a series on the essence of calculus,

3
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:23,599
and I'll be publishing the following videos once per day for the next 10 days.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,911
The goal here, as the name suggests, is to really get

5
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:29,720
the heart of the subject out in one binge-watchable set.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,179
But with a topic that's as broad as calculus, there's a lot of things that can mean,

7
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:36,200
so here's what I have in mind specifically.

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,413
Calculus has a lot of rules and formulas which

9
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:41,940
are often presented as things to be memorized.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,753
Lots of derivative formulas, the product rule, the chain rule,

11
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,978
implicit differentiation, the fact that integrals and derivatives are opposite,

12
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:52,460
Taylor series, just a lot of things like that.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,133
And my goal is for you to come away feeling like

14
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,079
you could have invented calculus yourself.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,638
That is, cover all those core ideas, but in a way that makes clear where they

16
00:01:01,638 --> 00:01:06,000
actually come from, and what they really mean, using an all-around visual approach.

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,427
Inventing math is no joke, and there is a difference between being

18
00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:14,040
told why something's true, and actually generating it from scratch.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,091
But at all points, I want you to think to yourself, if you were an early mathematician,

20
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:22,032
pondering these ideas and drawing out the right diagrams,

21
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:26,240
does it feel reasonable that you could have stumbled across these truths yourself?

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,569
In this initial video, I want to show how you might stumble into the core ideas of

23
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:35,566
calculus by thinking very deeply about one specific bit of geometry,

24
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:36,840
the area of a circle.

25
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,040
Maybe you know that this is pi times its radius squared, but why?

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,460
Is there a nice way to think about where this formula comes from?

27
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,326
Well, contemplating this problem and leaving yourself open to exploring the

28
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:53,545
interesting thoughts that come about can actually lead you to a glimpse of three

29
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:57,920
big ideas in calculus, integrals, derivatives, and the fact that they're opposites.

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,840
But the story starts more simply, just you and a circle, let's say with radius 3.

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,382
You're trying to figure out its area, and after going through a lot of

32
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:13,485
paper trying different ways to chop up and rearrange the pieces of that area,

33
00:02:13,485 --> 00:02:16,852
many of which might lead to their own interesting observations,

34
00:02:16,852 --> 00:02:21,060
maybe you try out the idea of slicing up the circle into many concentric rings.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,807
This should seem promising because it respects the symmetry of the circle,

36
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:29,460
and math has a tendency to reward you when you respect its symmetries.

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,060
Let's take one of those rings, which has some inner radius r that's between 0 and 3.

38
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,922
If we can find a nice expression for the area of each ring like this one,

39
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:42,254
and if we have a nice way to add them all up,

40
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:45,500
it might lead us to an understanding of the full circle's area.

41
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,120
Maybe you start by imagining straightening out this ring.

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,990
And you could try thinking through exactly what this new shape is and what its

43
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,180
area should be, but for simplicity, let's just approximate it as a rectangle.

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,862
The width of that rectangle is the circumference of the original ring,

45
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:05,440
which is 2 pi times r, right?

46
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,060
I mean, that's essentially the definition of pi.

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,379
And its thickness?

48
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,151
Well, that depends on how finely you chopped up the circle in the first place,

49
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:15,620
which was kind of arbitrary.

50
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,095
In the spirit of using what will come to be standard calculus notation,

51
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:24,431
let's call that thickness dr for a tiny difference in the radius from one ring to

52
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:24,960
the next.

53
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,879
Maybe you think of it as something like 0.1.

54
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,849
So approximating this unwrapped ring as a thin rectangle,

55
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:37,600
its area is 2 pi times r, the radius, times dr, the little thickness.

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,437
And even though that's not perfect, for smaller and smaller choices of dr,

57
00:03:42,437 --> 00:03:46,481
this is actually going to be a better and better approximation for that area,

58
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:50,993
since the top and the bottom sides of this shape are going to get closer and closer to

59
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:52,599
being exactly the same length.

60
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,933
So let's just move forward with this approximation,

61
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:58,701
keeping in the back of our minds that it's slightly wrong,

62
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:02,360
but it's going to become more accurate for smaller and smaller choices of dr.

63
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,400
That is, if we slice up the circle into thinner and thinner rings.

64
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,383
So just to sum up where we are, you've broken up the area of the circle into

65
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:17,190
all of these rings, and you're approximating the area of each one of those as

66
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,058
2 pi times its radius times dr, where the specific value for that inner radius

67
00:04:22,058 --> 00:04:26,804
ranges from 0 for the smallest ring up to just under 3 for the biggest ring,

68
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:31,979
spaced out by whatever the thickness is that you choose for dr, something like 0.1.

69
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,974
And notice that the spacing between the values here corresponds to the

70
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:41,300
thickness dr of each ring, the difference in radius from one ring to the next.

71
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,012
In fact, a nice way to think about the rectangles approximating each

72
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:49,820
ring's area is to fit them all upright side by side along this axis.

73
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,820
Each one has a thickness dr, which is why they fit so snugly right there together,

74
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,231
and the height of any one of these rectangles sitting above some specific value of r,

75
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:04,000
like 0.6, is exactly 2 pi times that value.

76
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,960
That's the circumference of the corresponding ring that this rectangle approximates.

77
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,549
Pictures like this 2 pi r can get tall for the screen,

78
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:16,922
I mean 2 times pi times 3 is around 19, so let's just throw up a y axis that's

79
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:21,350
scaled a little differently so that we can actually fit all of these rectangles

80
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,180
on the screen.

81
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,941
A nice way to think about this setup is to draw the graph of 2 pi r,

82
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:29,540
which is a straight line that has a slope 2 pi.

83
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,800
Each of these rectangles extends up to the point where it just barely touches that graph.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,460
Again, we're being approximate here.

85
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,014
Each of these rectangles only approximates the

86
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:42,220
area of the corresponding ring from the circle.

87
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,243
But remember, that approximation, 2 pi r times dr,

88
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:50,800
gets less and less wrong as the size of dr gets smaller and smaller.

89
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,966
And this has a very beautiful meaning when we're

90
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,540
looking at the sum of the areas of all those rectangles.

91
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,057
For smaller and smaller choices of dr, you might at first

92
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:03,140
think that turns the problem into a monstrously large sum.

93
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,560
I mean, there's many many rectangles to consider,

94
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,400
and the decimal precision of each one of their areas is going to be an

95
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,199
absolute nightmare.

96
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,300
But notice, all of their areas in aggregate just looks like the area under a graph.

97
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,365
And that portion under the graph is just a triangle,

98
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:23,400
a triangle with a base of 3 and a height that's 2 pi times 3.

99
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:30,500
So its area, 1 half base times height, works out to be exactly pi times 3 squared.

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,133
Or if the radius of our original circle was some other value,

101
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:38,660
capital R, that area comes out to be pi times r squared.

102
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,460
And that's the formula for the area of a circle.

103
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,412
It doesn't matter who you are or what you typically think of math,

104
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:47,379
that right there is a beautiful argument.

105
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,818
But if you want to think like a mathematician here,

106
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:55,195
you don't just care about finding the answer,

107
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:58,920
you care about developing general problem-solving tools and techniques.

108
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,766
So take a moment to meditate on what exactly just happened and why it worked,

109
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:07,587
because the way we transitioned from something approximate to something

110
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:11,780
precise is actually pretty subtle and cuts deep to what calculus is all about.

111
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,909
You had this problem that could be approximated with the sum of many small numbers,

112
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:24,060
each of which looked like 2 pi r times dr, for values of r ranging between 0 and 3.

113
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,947
Remember, the small number dr here represents our choice for the thickness of each ring,

114
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:32,979
for example 0.1.

115
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,639
And there are two important things to note here.

116
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,639
First of all, not only is dr a factor in the quantities we're adding up,

117
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,580
2 pi r times dr, it also gives the spacing between the different values of r.

118
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,520
And secondly, the smaller our choice for dr, the better the approximation.

119
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,203
Adding all of those numbers could be seen in a different,

120
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:58,469
pretty clever way as adding the areas of many thin rectangles

121
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:02,419
sitting underneath a graph, the graph of the function 2 pi r in this case.

122
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,426
Then, and this is key, by considering smaller and smaller choices for dr,

123
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:12,587
corresponding to better and better approximations of the original problem, the sum,

124
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:15,906
thought of as the aggregate area of those rectangles,

125
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:18,180
approaches the area under the graph.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,477
And because of that, you can conclude that the answer to the original question,

127
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:28,520
in full unapproximated precision, is exactly the same as the area underneath this graph.

128
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,261
A lot of other hard problems in math and science can be broken down and

129
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:38,360
approximated as the sum of many small quantities,

130
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:43,940
like figuring out how far a car has traveled based on its velocity at each point in time.

131
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,770
In a case like that, you might range through many different points in time,

132
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,261
and at each one multiply the velocity at that time times a tiny change in time, dt,

133
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:57,859
which would give the corresponding little bit of distance traveled during that little

134
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:58,180
time.

135
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,156
I'll talk through the details of examples like this later in the series,

136
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:07,378
but at a high level many of these types of problems turn out to be equivalent

137
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:12,140
to finding the area under some graph, in much the same way that our circle problem did.

138
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,147
This happens whenever the quantities you're adding up,

139
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:19,037
the one whose sum approximates the original problem,

140
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:23,240
can be thought of as the areas of many thin rectangles sitting side by side.

141
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,780
If finer and finer approximations of the original problem correspond to thinner and

142
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:35,106
thinner rings, then the original problem is equivalent to finding the area under some

143
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:35,540
graph.

144
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,423
Again, this is an idea we'll see in more detail later in the series,

145
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:43,180
so don't worry if it's not 100% clear right now.

146
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,151
The point now is that you, as the mathematician having just

147
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:50,578
solved a problem by reframing it as the area under a graph,

148
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:54,520
might start thinking about how to find the areas under other graphs.

149
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,318
We were lucky in the circle problem that the relevant area turned out to be a triangle,

150
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:03,760
but imagine instead something like a parabola, the graph of x2.

151
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,013
What's the area underneath that curve, say between

152
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,680
the values of x equals 0 and x equals 3?

153
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,760
Well, it's hard to think about, right?

154
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,019
And let me reframe that question in a slightly different way.

155
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,060
We'll fix that left endpoint in place at 0, and let the right endpoint vary.

156
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,556
Are you able to find a function, a of x, that gives

157
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:34,180
you the area under this parabola between 0 and x?

158
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,580
A function a of x like this is called an integral of x2.

159
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,603
Calculus holds within it the tools to figure out what an integral like this is,

160
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,200
but right now it's just a mystery function to us.

161
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,318
We know it gives the area under the graph of x2 between some fixed left

162
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,920
point and some variable right point, but we don't know what it is.

163
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,849
And again, the reason we care about this kind of question is not just for

164
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:03,980
the sake of asking hard geometry questions, it's because many practical

165
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,053
problems that can be approximated by adding up a large number of small

166
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:12,300
things can be reframed as a question about an area under a certain graph.

167
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,372
I'll tell you right now that finding this area, this integral function,

168
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:21,992
is genuinely hard, and whenever you come across a genuinely hard question in math,

169
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:25,777
a good policy is to not try too hard to get at the answer directly,

170
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:29,339
since usually you just end up banging your head against a wall.

171
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,780
Instead, play around with the idea, with no particular goal in mind.

172
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,564
Spend some time building up familiarity with the interplay between the function

173
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:42,360
defining the graph, in this case x2, and the function giving the area.

174
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,020
In that playful spirit, if you're lucky, here's something you might notice.

175
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:54,779
When you slightly increase x by some tiny nudge dx, look at the resulting change in area,

176
00:11:54,779 --> 00:12:00,420
represented with this sliver I'm going to call da for a tiny difference in area.

177
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,507
That sliver can be pretty well approximated with a rectangle,

178
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:08,620
one whose height is x2 and whose width is dx.

179
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,227
And the smaller the size of that nudge dx, the

180
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:15,020
more that sliver actually looks like a rectangle.

181
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,080
This gives us an interesting way to think about how a of x is related to x2.

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,578
A change to the output of a, this little da, is about equal to x2,

183
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:30,185
where x is whatever input you started at, times dx,

184
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:34,000
the little nudge to the input that caused a to change.

185
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,316
Or rearranged, da divided by dx, the ratio of a tiny change in a to the tiny

186
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:45,779
change in x that caused it, is approximately whatever x2 is at that point.

187
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,760
And that's an approximation that should get better

188
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,960
and better for smaller and smaller choices of dx.

189
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,639
In other words, we don't know what a of x is, that remains a mystery.

190
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,500
But we do know a property that this mystery function must have.

191
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,972
When you look at two nearby points, for example 3 and 3.001,

192
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:10,185
consider the change to the output of a between those two points,

193
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:16,120
the difference between the mystery function evaluated at 3.001 and 3.001.

194
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,076
That change, divided by the difference in the input values, which in this case is 0.001,

195
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:28,100
should be about equal to the value of x2 for the starting input, in this case 3 squared.

196
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,416
And this relationship between tiny changes to the mystery function

197
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:38,440
and the values of x2 itself is true at all inputs, not just 3.

198
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,972
That doesn't immediately tell us how to find a of x,

199
00:13:41,973 --> 00:13:44,820
but it provides a very strong clue that we can work with.

200
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,740
And there's nothing special about the graph x2 here.

201
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,647
Any function defined as the area under some graph has this property,

202
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:58,592
that da divided by dx, a slight nudge to the output of a divided by a slight

203
00:13:58,592 --> 00:14:03,729
nudge to the input that caused it, is about equal to the height of the graph at

204
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:04,500
that point.

205
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,360
Again, that's an approximation that gets better and better for smaller choices of dx.

206
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,040
And here, we're stumbling into another big idea from calculus, derivatives.

207
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,107
This ratio da divided by dx is called the derivative of a, or more technically,

208
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:27,240
the derivative is whatever this ratio approaches as dx gets smaller and smaller.

209
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,037
I'll dive much more deeply into the idea of a derivative in the next video,

210
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:36,514
but loosely speaking it's a measure of how sensitive a function is to small changes in

211
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:37,079
its input.

212
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,174
You'll see as the series goes on that there are many ways you can visualize a derivative,

213
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:45,170
depending on what function you're looking at and how you think

214
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,740
about tiny nudges to its output.

215
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,154
We care about derivatives because they help us solve problems,

216
00:14:52,154 --> 00:14:57,140
and in our little exploration here, we already have a glimpse of one way they're used.

217
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,437
They are the key to solving integral questions,

218
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:03,420
problems that require finding the area under a curve.

219
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,670
Once you gain enough familiarity with computing derivatives,

220
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,581
you'll be able to look at a situation like this one where you don't know what a function

221
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:15,560
is, but you do know that its derivative should be x2,

222
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,760
and from that reverse engineer what the function must be.

223
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,826
This back and forth between integrals and derivatives,

224
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:27,994
where the derivative of a function for the area under a graph gives you

225
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:32,104
back the function defining the graph itself, is called the fundamental

226
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:33,320
theorem of calculus.

227
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,750
It ties together the two big ideas of integrals and derivatives,

228
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,360
and shows how each one is an inverse of the other.

229
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,305
All of this is only a high-level view, just a peek

230
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:49,860
at some of the core ideas that emerge in calculus.

231
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,420
And what follows in this series are the details, for derivatives and integrals and more.

232
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,105
At all points, I want you to feel that you could have invented calculus yourself,

233
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:03,435
that if you drew the right pictures and played with each idea in just the right way,

234
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:07,255
these formulas and rules and constructs that are presented could have just

235
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:10,260
as easily popped out naturally from your own explorations.

236
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,305
And before you go, it would feel wrong not to give the people who supported this

237
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:20,131
series on Patreon a well-deserved thanks, both for their financial backing as

238
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:23,860
well as for the suggestions they gave while the series was being developed.

239
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,888
You see, supporters got early access to the videos as I made them,

240
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:31,560
and they'll continue to get early access for future essence-of type series.

241
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,240
And as a thanks to the community, I keep ads off of new videos for their first month.

242
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,462
I'm still astounded that I can spend time working on videos like these,

243
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:43,420
and in a very direct way, you are the one to thank for that.
