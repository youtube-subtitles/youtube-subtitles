2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,920
do you guys go to the gym I go to the

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,439
gym but you already knew that but I

4
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:10,679
don't think I'll ever be as buff as this

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,000
kangaroo look at

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,799
that oh my

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,560
God he's like an

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,199
alien holy [ __ ] like he is jacked like

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,119
has he been stacking do you even lift

10
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:30,359
bro yes I'm intimidating I feel like

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,279
he's about to kick my ass like like yo

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,840
bro I'll rip your head off and stuff it

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,719
in my pouch like a trophy [ __ ]

14
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,960
now the version you guys sent me only

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,559
has 12,000 views so unless there's

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,719
another copy out there I think fairly

17
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,760
fresh look at that oh my God and I don't

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,280
blame the cameraman for laughing his ass

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,199
off me how do you even get this buff

20
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:50,520
yeah I've been bench pressing koala

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,320
bears all day you know I typically eat

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,640
plants and berries but no trans fat you

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
know can you spot me you know it even

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,280
seems like he's looking for an excuse to

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,160
flex like yep you should check out the

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,719
other exhibits over

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,158
there so this next video is great it's

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,760
really squirrel so this is someone's pet

29
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,320
squirrel trying to bury a nut in a dog

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,400
spur a I have nothing to say about this

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,159
other than it's [ __ ] cute and like it

32
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,119
is cute but he makes a serious attempt

33
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,600
to cover up that nut no no one will

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,040
think to look here so I found this over

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,920
on a Blog I read sometimes called io9

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,520
and it has 4 million views damn so it's

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,079
blowing up and why do they have a pet

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,040
squirrel and like why isn't that dog

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,560
murdering that squirrel look I'm not

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,799
saying the dog should murder the

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,720
squirrel it's just all right I have four

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,399
cats and when they see a squirrel

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,600
they're

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,399
like and if you look at the dog the dog

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,719
just couldn't be more apathetic I mean

46
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,320
he just doesn't care he's like you know

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,680
all those [ __ ] I have to give I buried

48
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,799
them in the backyard and if you're

49
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,119
curious how the video ends it looks like

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,000
the squirrel and up hiding his nuts in

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,520
the laundry basket now high-s speed

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,799
chases will never not be exciting but

53
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,320
this is the first time I've ever seen

54
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,280
one where the cop was actually wearing a

55
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,360
camera [ __ ] now this cop's

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,480
actually not a traditional cop he's

57
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,120
apparently part of the Arkansas Game and

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,959
Fish Commission so if you're thinking

59
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,200
about fishing without a permit he will

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,560
[ __ ] you up now the video gets

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,160
unfortunately funny when the officer

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,720
catches the suspect who appears to be a

63
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
total

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,879
methhead

65
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,840
[ __ ] now this whole scene apparently

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,120
went down back in August of 2012 and

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,319
it's just now blowing up either that or

68
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,720
it's an elaborate commercial for Google

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
Glass see to me this is like the real

70
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,239
life Breaking Bad people fantasize about

71
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,400
living this Breaking Bad life life but

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,200
in reality that's what the real Jesse

73
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,319
Pinkman would look like now there's a

74
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,519
lot of contention about how the officer

75
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,120
handled the arrest after the suspect got

76
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,720
out of the car but you know if you're on

77
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,840
met driving on the wrong side of the

78
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,799
highway endangering lives I'd say

79
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,680
getting cursed at with a gun stuck to

80
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,840
your neck it's a possibility you know I

81
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,040
got of feel bad for the guy but it's

82
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,799
like that with 80% of the videos that

83
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,120
you send me it's like I feel bad for the

84
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,680
person but at the same time I'm like

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,480
dude what the [ __ ] were you thinking see

86
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,000
and now this guy he's busted he's going

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,760
to go to jail this will probably be his

88
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,720
cellmate do you even [ __ ] bro and you

89
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,159
know what else after seeing this video

90
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,560
I'm seriously having second thoughts

91
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,319
about ever doing meth but that's all my

92
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,920
